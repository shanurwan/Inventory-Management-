# 🌟 Excel VBA Inventory Management System – Automating Inventory with Intelligence 🌟

## 🧩 Project Overview
In today’s fast-paced supply chain and logistics environment, inventory accuracy and timely stock replenishment are essential. This project introduces a fully automated inventory management system built using Excel VBA, designed to streamline stock tracking, minimize manual effort, and improve operational decision-making.

## 🔧 Key Features
1️⃣ Automated Data Entry via UserForm
Developed an intuitive VBA-powered UserForm that enables users to enter product information efficiently.

Key fields:
• Product ID
• Product Name
• Quantity in Stock
• Reorder Level
• Supplier

On form submission, data is appended directly to the inventory table with zero manual formatting required.

2️⃣ Reorder Level Alerts
Implemented VBA logic to monitor stock levels in real-time.

Automatically compares current stock against reorder thresholds.

Critical items are flagged visually to ensure timely replenishment and avoid stockouts.

3️⃣ Color-Coded Visual Indicators
Used conditional formatting via VBA to apply:

Red for critical low stock

Yellow for nearing reorder level

Green for sufficient inventory

Enhances readability and supports fast decision-making.

4️⃣ Scalable & Customizable Architecture
Built with adaptability in mind:

Easily extend fields (e.g., pricing, lead time).

Compatible with growing inventory sizes.

Future-ready for integration with more complex modules (e.g., order automation, supplier KPIs).
